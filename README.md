## Hi there 👋 I'm Oluwawunmi 

I write about the tools and libraries developers are usually expected to just *figure out on their own*.  
Instead of spending hours digging through docs or random GitHub issues, you’ll find clear, practical guides here.  

### 🧑‍💻 What I write about
- New developer tools & libraries (and when they’re actually worth using)  
- Backend workflows, debugging, and automation tricks  
- AI-assisted coding and prompt design that actually helps you ship faster  

### 📚 Recent Guides
- [Understanding Valibot: Why It’s Different & When To Use It](https://bit.ly/42eB6CM)  
- [Best Free ChatGPT Alternatives for Coding in 2025](https://bit.ly/4mEuAwi)  

### ✨ Why I do this
Because I know how frustrating it is to be handed a tool with the unspoken expectation that you’ll “just figure it out.” I break things down so you don’t have to grind through bad docs or scattered resources.
